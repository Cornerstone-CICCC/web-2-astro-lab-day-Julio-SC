# Starting My Journey

Every journey begins with a single step, and this article marks the start of my path as a developer. As a beginner, I’m learning to code, embracing challenges, and celebrating small victories along the way. 

In this article, I share why I decided to become a full-stack developer, my first impressions of coding, and the skills I’m eager to learn. It’s a mix of excitement, curiosity, and determination to grow in this fascinating world of technology.

Join me as I reflect on what inspired me to take this leap and where I hope this journey will lead!
